# SSS Calculator

SSS calculator is a system that calculates the grade of a student from a score input, assigns merits to drivers based on their speed input and calculates the net salary of an individual from their basic salary and benefits.
This project was issued as part of a code challange issued by Moringa School on 26th November 2022, with the aim of helping students streamline their thought process to solving Java Script (JS) problems of this class.

## Installation

SSS Calculator does not require to many external resources to function, albeit the follwoing;
Live Server: In order to run the html webpage, the Live Server extension for VS Code, or any equiva1lent system is recommended.
All content used in the presentation of the code in the webs1te is provided within the repository and is copyright free.

### Technologies

SSS Calculator has been written in the following languages.
Java Script.
HTML
CSS

## Launch

This project does not have minimum requirements. It is yet to be hosted on any server and would therefore only run through the go-live function while on the ScoreSpeedSalarygen.html file. 
After going live, the page displays requests for all variable inputs. 

## Illustration

Once the page is live, The page is divided into three sections, with each serving a different function while also requiring a different input.

### Technical overview 

In the first section, the user is required to input a value that falls within the accepted parameter 0 and 100. On clicking enter, JS computes and outputs a grade, relative to the following score categories:

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

In the second section, the user is required to input his/ her driving speed. JS code then outputs a value that either revokes, accepts or issues demerit points based on the speed that has been logged in.
If the speed is greater than 70, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points. If the speed is less than 70, this is acceptable and the message "OK" is printed.

In the third section, the user is required to input their basic salary and benefits. This totals up to their taxeable income which is then run through an algorithm in JS that computes their net salary, based on the revised figures from KRA, NSSF and NHIF. The links to these values and further relevant information is provided below.
